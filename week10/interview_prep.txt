Before an interview I would consider past experiences that I might be asked about. I would go on youtube to refresh my memory about any
of the technical aspects of the interview, as well as review old code. I would research the orginazation to find more about what they do and
what the culture is like. I would read back through the job description to make sure I know all of the skills they will be looking for. I would
find appropriate clothing to wear for the interview, and double check the route I wll be driving. I would also leave early to account for something
going wrong, but not actually walk in too early before the interview.
