1. Give me an example of a time you managed numerous responsibilities. How did you handle that?
While working in a snowcone shack, I had to manage everything all at once, and had to fix any problems that came up. I quickly found out
that multitasking was very important, but making sure everything was done correctly was the most crucial aspect. I have learned that
when managing many responsibilites, it is important to take time to ensure things get done right, without spending too much time on them.
Doing things in order of priority mattered a lot while working in the snowcone shack. The ice shaver would break down very often, and it always
seemed like that was the most important part, but taking orders was even more important. A broken machine doesn't matter if there are no snowcones
that need to be made. 

2. Tell me about a time you were under a lot of pressure. What was going on, and how did you get through it?
While developing a software application, my team and I had one last day to finish a part of the app that was crucial for it to be functional.
The day before we had planned out what we needed to do and the timeline it needed to be finished by. Working down to the last minute was very
stressful, but our team managed to remain calm and we were able to finish it before the deadline. Planning out everything that needed to get
done and having everyone on the same page was very important for finishing in time. 

3. Sometimes itâ€™s just not possible to get everything on your to-do list done. Tell me about a time your responsibilities got a little 
overwhelming. What did you do?
While planning out a capstone application, our team had some very ambitious ideas of what they wanted the app to be. We worked out a plan and
started coding but soon we realized that we would not be able to finish everything we wanted to do in time. We came back together as a team
and talked through everything that needed to get done for the app to be fun and functional, and once we had a plan for that we were able to get 
back to work. We were very happy in the end with how it turned out, and dialing back our expectations was a big part of that. 

4. Tell me about your proudest professional accomplishment.
During my last year of high school, I wanted to enter the web application event for my Business Professionals club, but no one currently in the
club would have been able to work on the team. I went out and found people who would be able to work on the team and brought them into the club.
We worked on our app for months and all that work payed off when we placed top 10 nationally for the event.

5. Describe a time when your team or company was undergoing some change. How did that impact you, and how did you adapt?
I was working as a pizza delivery driver for Dominos at the beginning of the pandemic. Almost overnight, everything that we were doing needed to
change in order to ensure the safety of everyone. We started doing contactless deliveries as well as sanitization between every delivery. Being able
to adapt quickly to all the changes was very important because lives depended on it.
